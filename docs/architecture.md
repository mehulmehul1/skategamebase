# Technical Architecture

## System Components

### Frontend (Mobile)
- React Native for cross-platform development
- MapBox for real-time location rendering
- Web3 wallet integration for crypto features
- Push notification system
- Offline support for core features

### Backend
1. Core Services (Node.js/TypeScript)
   - User Authentication
   - Game Management
   - Social Features
   - Location Services
   - Push Notifications

2. Real-time System
   - WebSocket server for live updates
   - Redis for real-time data caching
   - Geospatial indexing

3. Blockchain Integration
   - Smart Contracts (Solidity)
   - Token System
   - Attestation System
   - Ranking System

### Database Structure
1. PostgreSQL (Main Database)
   - User profiles
   - Friendship connections
   - Spot information
   - Game history
   - Challenge records

2. Redis (Real-time Data)
   - Active user locations
   - Live games
   - Temporary session data

3. IPFS (Decentralized Storage)
   - Spot media
   - Game proofs
   - Attestations

### Smart Contracts
1. Token Contract
   - ERC20 implementation
   - Minting/burning logic
   - Transfer restrictions

2. Game Contract
   - Challenge creation
   - Wager management
   - Result verification
   - Reward distribution

3. Reputation Contract
   - Rank management
   - Attestation storage
   - Privilege management

## Security Considerations
1. Location Privacy
   - Granular privacy controls
   - Location data encryption
   - Temporary data retention

2. Transaction Security
   - Multi-sig for high-value transactions
   - Rate limiting
   - Fraud detection

3. Social Security
   - User verification
   - Content moderation
   - Report system

## Scalability Design
1. Horizontal Scaling
   - Microservices architecture
   - Load balancing
   - Regional deployment

2. Data Optimization
   - Geospatial indexing
   - Caching strategies
   - Data pruning

3. Blockchain Optimization
   - Layer 2 scaling
   - Batch processing
   - State channel implementation
